    profile: "I’m a front-end developer that is always looking for new, exciting oppotunities. I focus on writing semantic HTML, using modern CSS practices and writing clean JavaScript. When building bigger projects, I mostly use React, but I can adapt to whatever tools are required. I’m based in Berlin, Germany, but I’m happy working remotely. When I’m not coding, you’ll find me making coffee. I enjoy using different brewing techniques and practicing my latte art. Why not have a look at my work?",
    contact: "I’d love to hear about what you’re working on and how I could assist. I’m always on the lookout for new and exciting projects to sink my teeth in to. Currently I am based in Berlin, and am open to work in the city, but I am interested in other opportunities as well.",
